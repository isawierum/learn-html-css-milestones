  <blockquote cite="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Jane_Eyre/CJpBAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=automaton">
    “Do you think I am an automaton? — a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong! — I have as much soul as you — and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you. I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh: it is my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal — as we are!” <br>
  </blockquote>

    <h3>How To Procrastinate</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Start by finding something to do that is <em>nearly-productive</em>, so that you
        can feel as though you aren't procrastinating at all. This can be "organizing
        your calendar" or "running an errand". You could write a thank you note
        you've been putting off for a month, or research something like study
        abroad options that won't affect your life for a significant amound of
        time. The most popular productive procrastination methods are to clean
        (procrasticleaning) or to cook/bake (procrastibaking).</p></li>
      <li><p>Next, move on to something that could still be considered <em>semi-productive useful</em>.
        These are tasks that you do despite knowing that there is zero urgency, such as you've been "meaning to
        call a family member for a while" or decide to "grab some food" or, best of all, "go for a walk to 'focus'". While none of
        these tasks are accomplishing any sort of end goal such as cleaning, organizing, or baking
        that could be crossed off of a checklist, you are still <strong>doing</strong> something that could be viewed as productive.
        It should be noted that <em>semi-productive useful</em> should still be doing something you can convince
        yourself is useful, things that you don't need to do (you called your sister yesterday, make something
        at home instead of going out, you don't need to go for a walk) but maybe should do.</p></li>
      <li><p>Once all of these tasks are complete, move on to <em>semi-productive useless</em>, meaning tasks
      that have zero urgency, and are not in any way useful. For example, burning those audiobook CDs
      onto your computer, creating a new Spotify playlist, reaching out to a friend to tell them some incredibly
      trivial news, or spending time re-arranging your room. These are tasks that never needed to completed. If they weren't
      done, the world would continue to spin. But you do them anyway.</p></li>
      <li><p>Now it's time to move on to <em>useless</em> procrastination and give up. Do something stupid like watch TV, play a game, hang out with your friends. Maybe just stare at a wall.
      Anything to avoid what you're supposed to be doing.</p></li>
      <li><p>If you go through all of that and <em>still</em> need something to do,
      start your DIG 245 homework but spend an inordinate amount of time creating
      a list of instructions on how to procrastinate.</p></li>
